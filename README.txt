The code can be found on Github at https://github.com/Liveo123/RedWine_and_Phishing.git

There are two code Jupyter Notebook files, 'phishing.ipynb' containing code that runs against the UCI phishing data and 'redwine.ipynb' which runs against the UCI Red wine data.

The data for both of the files are stored in csv files in the data folder. The Phishing data is stored in phishing.csv and the Red Wine is stored in 'winequality-red.csv'.

The following libraries need to be installed:
pandas==1.1.4
numpy==1.18.4
seaborn==0.11.0
scikit-learn==0.23.2
matplotlib==3.2.2
scipy==1.5.4

The above libraries should work with the latest versions, but the matplotlib version is important as other versions will give errors.

In the 2nd panel of each of the Jupyter Notebook files, the folder name will need to be changed to the folder on your local computer where all the project files are placed.

You should then be able to simply run each panel in order in each of the Jupyter files.
